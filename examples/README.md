### Getting started

#### Project setup

Run the following command to install the dependencies of your App:

```sh
npm install
```

#### Build and run in development mode

Run your App in development mode:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This command uses Vite to fire up a local server, with Hot Reloading support. Visit the provided link in your web browser to see the App in action.

#### Build the App for production

Create an optimized and minified version of your App:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create a production version of the app in the `dist` folder.
