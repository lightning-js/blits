# Directives

Blits comes with a few built-in attributes that tap into specific behaviour provided by the framework - also known as _directives_. Most of them can be used in the template on both Elements and Components.

## Show-directive

The `show` attribute allows you to conditionally show and hide Components and Elements.

When passed a _truthy_ value, such as `true` or `1`, the element will be made visible. And when passed a _falsey_ value (`false` or `0`) it will not be visible.

```xml
<Element>
  <Element w="100" h="100" color="purple" :show="$active"></Element>
  <Element w="100" h="100" y="200" color="purple" show="false"></Element>
</Element>
```

## Is-directive

The `is` directive allows you to dynamically instantiate a Component based on a `state` variable or a passed `prop`.

It is very useful in combination with API driven Apps, where the type of Component to use, depends on what data is returned (i.e. a `Poster` or a `HeroImage`).

The `is`-component should always be used together with the built-in `Component`-tag.

```js
export default Blits.Component('DynamicComponents', {
  template: `
    <Element>
      <Component is="$firstComponent" />
      <Component is="$secondComponent" x="500" />
    </Element>
  `,
  props: ['firstComponent', 'secondComponent'],
})
```

At the moment it's not possible to use the `is`-attribute as a _reactive_ attribute and have a component change type after instantiation.

## Ref-attribute

The declarative coding style that is promoted in Blits components, should generally remove the need to directly interact with individual Elements or Components in your template. However, in some cases you may need to reference them directly. For example, in order to delegate the focus.

For this use case, you can specify a `ref`-attribute on Elements (or Components). And by using the helper function `this.$select()`,  which is available on every Blits component, you can gain access to the child Element or Component inside your business logic.

The `$select()`-function accepts the `ref`-value that you are looking for as a single argument, and returns the Element or Component if found.
